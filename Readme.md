This is a practice project I made in 2019. Reposted here.

# Functions
- This is a message board in chinese.
- User system with login / register / password management / email verification.
- Comment system. User can create and view comments.

# Structure
For details you can view Readme(CHI) in chinese (also with pictures). But as a naive toy project made years ago, I guess detailed explanations it contains is no longer needed. It contains many screenshots for you to understand how it looks like after installation.

## Frontend
JS + Bootstrap + xml

## Backend 
implemented a simple http server in /framework/httphandler.py

Data stored in MySQL.

API implementation in /framework/cgi
